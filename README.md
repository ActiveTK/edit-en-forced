# ![Application Icon for Edit](./assets/edit.svg) Force-English Fork of Edit

A simple editor for simple needs, but in English only.

We DO NOT want the commandline editor to have localization.

We DO BELIEVE that all the editor work on console should be English.

As the original build do NOT provide any options to switch the language at runtime, we simply forked, patched, and made what we want.

Any issues or pull requests are all welcome. Should you have any questions, please let me know. By [ActiveTK.](https://x.com/ActiveTK5929)

This editor pays homage to the classic [MS-DOS Editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Editor), but with a modern interface and input controls similar to VS Code. The goal is to provide an accessible editor that even users largely unfamiliar with terminals can easily use.
